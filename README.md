# Deep-Learning-Repo

This is a repository with all the Deep Learning projects I have and will implement. 

I have completed 2 projects now.
1. Image classification of CIFAR-10 dataset using CNN implementation Pytorch.
2. Image classification of MNIST dataset using CNN implementation Pytorch using GPU.
